- Handle network errors gracefully
- Validate content before storage
- Respect robots.txt

## Content Structure
- Title
- Content
- Publication date
- Source URL
- Author (if available)
- Featured image
- Categories/tags

## Error Handling
- Log all errors with timestamps
- Implement retry logic (max 3 attempts)
